I am Blessing Chinazaekpere DeNwigwe-Aggrey, currently a medical student in Dominica. I love to read, listen to music, go to the beach and cook. I'm enrolled in the software development program at stutern and i'm very grateful to them for the opportunity.
People confuse me as an ambivert but, i'm actually an introvrt. I am proudly Nigerian and also a proud Christian.
